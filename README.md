# InTheatersSoon / Reel Time Movies (not sure what name is better)
App mainly for learning purposes. Shows movies coming to the theaters soon. Easy Cheesy.

## Tech
For this I'll be jumping around as I learn new tech, if you look thru the commits and PRs you'll notice me migrating to and away from random tech. I figure if I can learn how to implement it and then refactor away to a new method and keep things working I must have learned something, right?

- Unstated (For global state, like user (Saved movies, username).
- Redux (migrated from Unstated, that worked well, to Redux, Unstated was more simple but I know Redux has its benefits) Still working on my commmit for this refactor.
- Styled-Components (Very convenient for reusable components without having to deal with specificity issues in SASS files).
- Firebase (Needed something to get started fast and this was the easiest to learn since I don't know backend yet. Though I am learning GraphQL with WesBos and later Node).
- React-Navigation (Used it at work for routing around the our mobile app. Has been fairly nice. Works really well for my simple app)
